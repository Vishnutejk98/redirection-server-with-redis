Lumen Rough Notes

It a microframework that is build on laravel framework.
It would remove unwanted components that would be coming with larvel framwork. 

In the project we would be developing 2 microservices called 
1. Book service 
2. Author service

Architecture
Extenral Service -> API GateWay -> OAuth2 -> BackendService 

Requirment : Php >= 7 & Composer


Create Porject:
composer create-project laravel/lumen LumenAuthorsApi 
-------- -------------- ------------ ProjectName

Run the project: 
php -S localhost:5000 -t .\public 

Initially you need to enable few of the components : LumenAuthorsApi\bootstrap\app.php
Such as 

: Facades 
In a Laravel application, a facade is a class that provides access to an object 
from the container. The machinery that makes this work is in the Facade class. 
Laravel's facades, and any custom facades you create, will extend the base

:Eloquent 
Laravel includes Eloquent, an object-relational mapper (ORM) that 
makes it enjoyable to interact with your database.

Commadns available 
php artisan

Create a table for the author as of the project
php artisan make:migration CreateAuthorsTable --create=authors
php artisan:migrate

Models - used to create map with the mysql table (ORM)
LumenAuthorsApi\app\Models\Author.php
Created a model 

$fillable = column name 
$hidden = coulmn which are hidden and not avalible for json
